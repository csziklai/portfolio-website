To make sure it’s clear, the recommendation was to use the label tag to associate the “search” text with its respective form control, the search bar.</p>\n            <img src={ao5} alt=\"screenshot of search bar\" />\n\n            <h4>Low contrast</h4>\n            <p>Another common issue was low color contrast. I used WAVE and a color contrast checker to check that the minimum ratio for AA compliance was met in text, buttons, and icons. This is where the redesign portion of the project occurred. For example, I redesigned the Total Consumption page below to meet AA color contrast standards.</p>\n            <img src={ao6} alt=\"the Total Consumption page after color contrast redesign\" />\n            <p className=\"caption\">The Total Consumption page after color contrast redesign</p>\n\n            <h4>Focus order</h4>\n            <p>I observed that the navigation order of links, form elements, and any other elements on the page followed a logical and intuitive order of focus.</p>\n\n            <h4>Keyboard skips over certain elements</h4>\n            <p>I found that when using keyboard-only navigation, certain elements would get skipped over, and thus be rendered inaccessible with the keyboard. A prominent example is the links, edit/delete icons, and checkboxes in the tables.</p>\n            <img src={ao7} alt=\"screenshot of a table in AclaraONE\" />\n            <p className=\"caption\">The columns under Device ID, Edit, and Delete would be inaccessible to keyboard-only users. The numbers in pink indicate a suggested focus order.</p>\n            \n            <h4>No skip navigation</h4>\n            <p>Another issue was the absence of a skip navigation. Thus, for keyboard-only users, there is no way to skip over all the navigation links, which can be frustrating and tedious. Especially, for an application with extensive navigation, it is important to have this feature. It can even by coded so that it’s not visually perceptible to non-assistive technology users, erasing any concerns of visual aesthetics or limited screen real estate.</p>\n\n            <h4>Orphaned form labels</h4>\n            <p>A common issue throughout almost all pages were orphaned form labels. This occurs when a form label is present, but not properly associated with a form control. In the example below, the label “Name” exists, but is not associated with the text box, which is the form control in this case. To fix this, associate the label text with the corresponding form control, or if it is a static form, then the corresponding text.</p>\n            <img src={ao8} alt=\"screenshot of form labels and form inputs\" />\n\n            <h3>Takeaways</h3>\n            <p>This summer proved to be a highly educational experience. I was able to take what I had learned about accessibility practices and see how it fit in the bigger picture of real-world accessibility compliance.</p>\n            <p>Additionally, I was able to get a glimpse of the inner workings of a company and how software teams, UX designers, and product managers work together to manage new features, updates, and bugs.</p>\n            <p>I also learned the importance of not being afraid to ask questions. There were times when I was unsure of how to proceed with the project, but after talking with my boss, I had clearer direction and understanding. Overall, I’m grateful for this experience and what it has taught me. It was truly an educational summer.</p>\n\n            <img src={groupic} alt=\"Aerial view of interns gathered outside near food trucks\" />\n            <p className=\"caption\">Aerial shot from the
