# My Portfolio Website

## Project Description
This website was created to highlight my projects. I created it using React.js.
Since this was my first project in React, I drew from @machadop1407 's react personal
portfolio website for guidance (https://github.com/machadop1407/react-personal-portfolio-website).

## Launch
To view the website, go to csziklai.com. To run the code, use the command "yarn start" after downloading the files and navigating to that directory.
